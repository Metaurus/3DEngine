This will be my attempt at creating a 3D engine in C++. These notes will document the entire learning process as well as all faults made during my work on this project.
Why C++? It has the speed and low-level capabilities of C, but with the added benefit of being object-oriented, perfect for a game engine. C++ uses the GCC compiler just
like C, but requires the additional flag of -lstdc++ (link standard C++) to compile properly.

Goals for this project:
-Use minimal amounts of C++ libraries, as building the engine from scratch will be more educational
-Be able to successfully display 3D shapes on the screen and build complex objects from them
    -Perhaps even be able to import 3D models
-Be able to move the camera around, to look at the 3D shapes from different angles
-Be able to develop a simplistic 3D game with this engine

These goals as they stand might be simplistic and are subject to change as I learn more about C++ and engines in general.

We will need access to the Windows operating system API which can be found in Windows.h.
